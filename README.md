# Human Action Recognition

This project implements a Human Action Recognition system using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2. It classifies different human actions from images with high accuracy.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Transfer learning with MobileNetV2
- Training with early stopping and learning rate scheduling
- Performance evaluation with classification report and confusion matrix
- Visualization of training history and sample predictions

## Dataset
Uses the "Human Action Recognition (HAR)" dataset containing images labeled with 15 action classes.

## Usage
1. Prepare dataset paths
2. Run preprocessing and training scripts
3. Evaluate and visualize results
4. Generate submission file for test data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Plotly
